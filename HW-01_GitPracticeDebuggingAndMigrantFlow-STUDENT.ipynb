    "If everything went as intended, the file should now show up on your GitHub account in the \"`cmse202-s20-turnin`\" repository inside the `hw-01` directory that you just created.  Periodically, **you'll be asked to commit your changes to the repository and push them to the remote GitHub location**. Of course, you can always commit your changes more often than that, if you wish.  It can be good to get into a habit of committing your changes any time you make a significant modification, or when you stop working on the project for a bit."

    "It is a very well thought out way to visualize the movement of migrants to and from the various countries of the world from 1990 to 2010. Some of the movement may surprise you. The data was collected originally for a paper in 2014 titled [\"Quantifying Global International Migration Flows\"](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/343/6178/1520/tab-figures-data). The database S2 in the link is the source of the data, an excel spread sheet. That spread sheet is in the D2L location for this homework and called `migrant_flows.xlsx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You read the sheet in the following way (in Excel):\n",
    "* you select a sheet at the bottom representing a 5 year period\n",
    "* the rows indicate the origin/source country\n",
    "* the columns represent the destination country\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the totals at the end of a row represent how many people left the country during that 5 year span and the column totals represent how many people entered the country during that 5 year span. Any particular cell indicates: row: leaving , col: entering. For example, on the sheet tab `1990-95`, `Australia` (row) had 67 people leave for `Aruba` (col).\n",

    "We are going to go over some issues this particular spreadsheet has that you may not have seen before. Having gotten through those issues, we can do some analysis and potentially some model building. \n",

Unfortunately, sometimes people decorate a spreadsheet with all kinds of helpful information for people which basically prevents you from getting the right headers setup in pandas.
